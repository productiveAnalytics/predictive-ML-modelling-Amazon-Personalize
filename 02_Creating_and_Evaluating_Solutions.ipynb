    "In this notebook, you will train several models using Amazon Personalize.\n",

    "1. [Create solutions](#solutions)\n",

    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, for the most part, the algorithms in Amazon Personalize (called recipes) look to solve different tasks, explained here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HRNN & HRNN-Metadata** - Recommends items based on previous user interactions with items.\n",
    "1. **HRNN-Coldstart** - Recommends new items for which interaction data is not yet available.\n",
    "1. **Personalized-Ranking** - Takes a collection of items and then orders them in probable order of interest using an HRNN-like approach.\n",
    "1. **SIMS (Similar Items)** - Given one item, recommends other items also interacted with by users.\n",
    "1. **Popularity-Count** - Recommends the most popular items, if HRNN or HRNN-Metadata do not have an answer - this is returned by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the use case, the algorithms all share a base of learning on user-item-interaction data which is defined by 3 core attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **UserID** - The user who interacted\n",
    "1. **ItemID** - The item the user interacted with\n",
    "1. **Timestamp** - The time at which the interaction occurred\n",
    "\n",
    "We also support event types and event values defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Type** - Categorical label of an event (browse, purchased, rated, etc).\n",
    "1. **Event Value** - A value corresponding to the event type that occurred. Generally speaking, we look for normalized values between 0 and 1 over the event types. For example, if there are three phases to complete a transaction (clicked, added-to-cart, and purchased), then there would be an event_value for each phase as 0.33, 0.66, and 1.0 respectfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The event type and event value fields are additional data which can be used to filter the data sent for training the personalization model. In this particular exercise we will not have an event type or event value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you need to have run the previous notebook, `01_Validating_and_Importing_User_Item_Interaction_Data`, where you created a dataset and imported interaction data into Amazon Personalize. At the end of that notebook, you saved some of the variable values, which you now need to load into this notebook."

Personalize uses all of the interaction data from 90% of the users (blue circles) to train the solution version, and the remaining 10% for evaluation. For each of the users in the remaining 10%, 90% of their interaction data (green circles) is used as input for the call to the trained model. The remaining 10% of their data (orange circle) is compared to the output produced by the model and used to calculate the evaluation metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "* *Relevant recommendation* refers to a recommendation that matches a value in the testing data for the particular user.\n",
    "* *Rank* refers to the position of a recommended item in the list of recommendations. Position 1 (the top of the list) is presumed to be the most relevant to the user.\n",
    "* *Query* refers to the internal equivalent of a GetRecommendations call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics produced by Personalize are:\n",
    "* **coverage**: The proportion of unique recommended items from all queries out of the total number of unique items in the training data (includes both the Items and Interactions datasets).\n",
    "* **mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25**: The [mean of the reciprocal ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank) of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries. This metric is appropriate if you're interested in the single highest ranked recommendation.\n",
    "* **normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K**: Discounted gain assumes that recommendations lower on a list of recommendations are less relevant than higher recommendations. Therefore, each recommendation is discounted (given a lower weight) by a factor dependent on its position. To produce the [cumulative discounted gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (DCG) at K, each relevant discounted recommendation in the top K recommendations is summed together. The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the ideal DCG such that NDCG is between 0 - 1. (The ideal DCG is where the top K recommendations are sorted by relevance.) Amazon Personalize uses a weighting factor of 1/log(1 + position), where the top of the list is position 1. This metric rewards relevant items that appear near the top of the list, because the top of a list usually draws more attention.\n",
    "* **precision_at_K**: The number of relevant recommendations out of the top K recommendations divided by K. This metric rewards precise recommendation of the relevant items.\n",

    "\n",
    "* If there is an existing recommendation system in place, this will have influenced the user's interaction history which you use to train your new solutions. This means the evaluation metrics are biased to favor the existing solution. If you work to push the evaluation metrics to match or exceed the existing solution, you may just be pushing the HRNN to behave like the existing solution and might not end up with something better.\n",
    "* The HRNN Coldstart recipe is difficult to evaluate using the metrics produced by Amazon Personalize. The aim of the recipe is to recommend items which are new to your business. Therefore, these items will not appear in the existing user transaction data which is used to compute the evaluation metrics. As a result, HRNN Coldstart will never appear to perform better than the other recipes, when compared on the evaluation metrics alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind these factors, the evaluation metrics produced by Personalize are generally useful for two cases:\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on the same recipe, but with different values for the hyperparameters.\n",
    "1. Comparing the performance of solution versions trained on different recipes (except HRNN Coldstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly evaluating a recommendation system is always best done through A/B testing while measuring actual business outcomes. Since recommendations generated by a system usually influence the user behavior which it is based on, it is better to run small experiments and apply A/B testing for longer periods of time. Over time, the bias from the existing model will fade."
